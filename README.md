Exploratory testing assistant for Chrome and Firefox. Adds common problematic values and edge cases to the context menu (right-click) for editable elements, so you can keep them handy and access them easily during exploratory testing sessions.  

## Features

* Convenient access to common boundaries and edge cases for exploratory testing
* Extend it with your own config files easily
* Works on input fields, text areas, content editable DIVs
* Works on multi-frame pages, but only if they are from the same domain
* Works in Chrome and Firefox
* Tiny overhead per page (<1k), no 3rd party library dependencies, completely passive, so it does not interfere with your web app execution in any way

## Usage

The easiest way to install the extension is from the [Chrome Web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/efhedldbjahpgjcneebmbolkalbhckfi) or [Mozilla Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bug-magnet/).

After installation, just right-click on any editable item on the page and you'll see a Bug Magnet submenu. Click an item there, and it will be inserted into the editable field.
